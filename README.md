# easyNvim
Coming soon




pip install pyfiglet rich



⚠️ **Windows Users: Run as Administrator**

If you're on Windows, you must run the installer with elevated privileges:

1. Right-click on PowerShell or CMD
2. Choose **"Run as Administrator"**
3. Then run:

    ```powershell
    cd path\to\easyNvim
    python nvim_install.py
    ```

Chocolatey and package installation will fail without this step.
